There are various ways to deploy a model, but a common method involves wrapping it in a service that exposes one or more endpoints that can receive input (e.g., text) and return the model\u2019s predictions. This approach allows the model\u2019s functionality to be integrated seamlessly into various applications, including customer-facing web frontends, internal analytics software, and automated data processing pipelines.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"futureWork":{"id":"futureWork","title":"Future Work","description":"The current Nimbus implementation provides a focused solution for deploying specific types of NLP models to AWS serverless infrastructure.
